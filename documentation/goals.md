# Goals

The following is set of goals any MVP product must meet before we consider releasing. These are not "requirements", but failing to meet these goals, would mean developing a different product entirely.

## Provide A User First Experience
As mentioned in our [vision](./vision-statement.md) statement, the main goal is to provide something that feature-rish, user-friendly and can accomodate any level of chess player.

The UX design of this project is almost as crucial as it's performance. Our first and foremost goal, is to provide the use with the best possible experience. Having something with great features and performance means nothing if the userbase cannot harness it. This application needs to be accesible, and also translated into several languages for it serve it's purpose in the missions statement.

## Provide An Application That Fills A Need
There is not much innovation happening in the world of chess applications. There is an outcry for a well documented, modern chess database application that actually uses a database rather than large PGN data files. 

I think there is need for a new application to try and solve this problem.

## Embrace Free Open Source Software
All TechMate-Chess repositories are free, and open-source. Our dependencies must also follow this. 

## Deliver Fast Search Speeds Over Large Datasets
For a new chess database application to be successful, it must be performant. Fast search speed will be a driving decision making fact in most cases, unless it compromises the user experience.
